LIMITATIONS

- Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radio are both operating on the same 2.4 GHz band. When
  both of them are used simultaneously, you may see slower communication speed
  and/or reduced communication range caused by radio interference. To avoid such
  the situation, use the Wi-Fi radio with the 5 GHz band (802.11a, 802.11ac or
  802.11an mode).

- When this software is uninstalled, you can not detect this uninstalled version
  again by ThinkVantage System Update and you need to manually install the
  software.

- Wi-Fi could not upgrade to the latest Wi-Fi version when OS is updated from
  Windows 7 to Windows 10. System Update cannot search this package when the
  Wi-Fi Driver Date: 2/22/2015 and Wi-Fi Driver version: 17.15.0.5 in Device
  Manager. Need to perform either of the following solutions:
  a) Download latest driver that can be found on Lenovo Support Site.
     Uninstall Wi-Fi driver in Programs and Features and re-install the
     downloaded Wi-Fi driver.
  b) Uninstall Wi-Fi driver in Programs and Features.
     Run and download new Wi-Fi via Thinkvantage System Update.

- Proset device will not be removed in Device Manager after WLAN driver
  uninstallation or after upgrade installation. Wi-Fi driver functionality will
  not be affected even if the Proset device still available in Device Manager.

- Wi-Fi "Intel PROSet/Wireless Software" entry can still be seen in Programs and
  Features after upgrade installation from Wi-Fi Driver version 20.70.11.3 or
  older versions, to Wi-Fi Driver version 20.70.14.1 or later versions. 
  User can remove this "Intel PROSet/Wireless Software" entry in Programs and
